This plugin provides Tagplay widget functionality to show social media posts managed by Tagplay (https://tagplay.co).

== Description ==

This is a plugin for integrating [Tagplay widgets](https://tagplay.co) into WordPress. It adds:

-  a WordPress widget that can be used in sidebars or other widget areas
-  a shortcode for use in posts or pages

Both the widget and shortcode are simple wrappers around Tagplay's widget, which pulls social media posts into a curated feed.
For more information, visit https://tagplay.co.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `tagplay-widget` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress admin.
3. Sign up on https://tagplay.co if you haven't already, create some feeds, and get some posts into them!
4. Click the name of the feed you want to integrate into your WordPress site on your Tagplay dashboard.
5. Click 'Publish'/'Get Code' in the upper right corner of the feed detail page.
6. Below the widget designer, click the WordPress button on the left under the 'Get Code' heading.
7. Follow the instructions there for either the widget or shortcode.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Tagplay? =

Tagplay is a service that allows you to collect posts from your social media accounts - or other public Twitter/Instagram
accounts - and pull them into 'feeds', optionally using hashtags to control where the post should go. Feeds can then be
integrated into your website, where they will automatically update whenever you make posts on your social media accounts.
For more information, visit https://tagplay.co.

= Do I need a Tagplay account to use this plugin? =

Yes, you will need a Tagplay account. Both the widget and shortcode are only wrappers around Tagplay's HTML/Javascript widget.
They require a Tagplay project ID, feed ID and authentication token.

= Why should I use Tagplay instead of a simple social media feed widget? =

Tagplay can combine feeds from multiple social media accounts into one, allows moderation, pinning and bumping within the
feed, and allows you to make certain feeds collect only posts with certain hashtags, making for a much greater level of
control over your content. For instance, a restaurant site could have both a Meal of the Day feed and a News feed, controlled
from the same social media account but one collecting only posts hashtagged #mealoftheday and one collecting only #news.

== Changelog ==

= 1.1 =
* Updates the default Tagplay widget version to 1.10.1. This new version offers greater control over the handling of hashtags in posts, links hashtags and mentions to appropriate searches on the originating site, and adds lightbox functionality.
* The 'Text' setting has been split into two settings, 'Hashtags' and 'Strip hash'. The former controls whether hashtags should be stripped from the end of a post, and the latter controls whether hashtags should have their initial # stripped, turning them into regular, unlinked words.
* A 'Lightbox' setting has been added, controlling whether clicking posts in your widget should open the post in a lightbox.

Old widgets using the shortcode will be automatically upgraded. To upgrade widgets in your theme, simply resave them on the Widgets page in the admin. Note that the 'Lightbox' setting is on by default in 1.1. If you do not wish to add lightbox functionality to your widget, you should uncheck the relevant box before saving.

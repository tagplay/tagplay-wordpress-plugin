Upload the `tagplay-widget` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.\r\n2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress admin.\r\n3. Sign up on [https://tagplay.co] if you haven't already, create some feeds, and get some posts into them!\r\n4. Click the name of the feed you want to integrate into your WordPress site on your Tagplay dashboard.\r\n5. Click 'Get Code' in the upper right corner of the feed detail page.\r\n6. Below the widget designer, click the WordPress button on the left under the 'Get Code' heading.\r\n7. Follow the instructions there for either the widget or shortcode.\r\n\r\n## Frequently Asked Questions\r\n\r\n### What is Tagplay?\r\n\r\nTagplay is a service that allows you to collect posts from your social media accounts - or even everyone's - and pull them\r\ninto 'feeds', optionally using hashtags to control where the post should go. Feeds can then be integrated into your website, where they will automatically update whenever you make posts on your social media accounts. For more information, visit [https://tagplay.co].\r\n\r\n### Do I need a Tagplay account to use this plugin?\r\n\r\nYes, you will need a Tagplay account. Both the widget and shortcode are only wrappers around Tagplay's HTML/Javascript widget. They require a Tagplay project ID, feed ID and authentication token.\r\n\r\n### Why should I use Tagplay instead of a simple social media feed widget?\r\n\r\nTagplay can combine feeds from multiple social media accounts into one, allows moderation, pinning and bumping within the\r\nfeed, and allows you to make certain feeds collect only posts with certain hashtags, making for a much greater level of\r\ncontrol over your content. For instance, a restaurant site could have both a Meal of the Day feed and a News feed, controlled from the same social media account but one collecting only posts hashtagged #mealoftheday and one collecting only #news.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n1.
